# Assured under this policy dies. Claims will be paid within 48 hours of
# receiving all the necessary documentation.
# On the death of a baby up to three months old or a Stillborn Child, a
# Funeral benefit will be paid provided that:
# • the Policyholder/Principal Life Assured or Spouse (if insured under
# this policy) is the mother, and
# • the death occurs after the 6-month Waiting Period.
# The Funeral benefit payable for Children (including babies) is restricted
# by law. This restriction also applies on any increases in the Benefit
# Amount (even through automatic benefit increases, if selected) from the
# date of that increase.

# The Funeral benefit pays a maximum of 2 Stillborn claims per policy
# (and per Life Assured if covered under more than one policy).
#   Double Accidental Death benefit
# Should the Policyholder/Principal Life Assured or Spouse (if insured
# under this policy) die because of an Accident (and within 14 days of
# the Accident) the Funeral benefit will be paid plus an additional amount
# equal to the Funeral benefit.
# The benefit does not apply in the event of the Life Assured committing
# suicide.
# Premium Waiver
# To qualify for the Premium Waiver benefit to be paid, the policy must
# have been active for 6 months, with at least 6 premiums being paid.
# Should the Principal Life Assured die, the remaining family members on
# the policy will remain covered for a further 6 months and no premiums
# will be payable.

# the premium waiver period. This benefit can only be claimed once.
# After 6 months, the spouse (or any adult member on the policy over
# the age of 18), will have the option to take over the policy as the
# Policyholder (with new premiums quoted for the new Policyholder).
# Payment of premiums will resume at this point and the Policyholder will
# need to make arrangements to pay the premiums.
# If the policy is not transferred to the spouse or another adult member
# on the policy, the policy and all related benefits will end.
#   Memorial benefit (if selected)
# The Memorial benefit will pay a Benefit Amount to the beneficiary when
# the Policyholder/Principal Life Assured or Spouse (if insured under this
